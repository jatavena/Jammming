# Jammming

This is a study project and a work in progress.  
The purpose is to practice **React** and working with **APIs** by creating an app that can search for music using the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

## Development Notes

- The project was originally started with **Vite**.
- Since Spotify does not allow `localhost` as a callback URI, I had to publish the app during development via **GitHub Pages**.
- Built with **React 19** + **Vite**.

## Future Plans

- Add playlist creation and saving to Spotify.
- Improve UI/UX and styling.
- Add error handling and loading states.
